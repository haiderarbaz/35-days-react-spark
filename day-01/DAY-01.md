## üîß React Learning Process

### First Way

Go in depth

- **Babel** - JavaScript compiler

- **Fibre** - React's reconciliation algorithm

- **Virtual DOM** - React's representation layer

- **DOM** - Document Object Model

- **Diff algo** - How React compares changes

- **Hydration** - Server-side rendering process

- **Tree shaking** - Performance optimization technique

### Second Way

Learn one concept at a time through building Projects :

- Todo

- Calculator

- GitHub ApI

and, much more

### React as a Library

Understand React's position in the ecosystem:

**React is a Library:**

- **Framework vs Library** comparison

  - No exceptions(rigid structure) vs freedom to choose your tools

- React gives you freedom to choose your tools

### Topics to Learn (In Order)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Core of React** (Create or UI manipulation, JSX)

- Make transferable using HTML

- Understanding JSX syntax

- Component creation basics

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Component Reusability**

- **Reusing of components** (Props)

- **Versioning of components** (Props)

- **How to propagate chnage** using Hooks:

  - useState

  - useEffect

  - Custom Hooks

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Additional Addons to React**

- **Router:** React-router-dom

- **Routing:** (React-router-v6 vs React-router-dom)

- **State Management:**

  - Redux, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Context API

---

## üèóÔ∏è When to Learn State Management?

Learn state management when your UI is **inconsistence** or you're facing:

- Problems in **fetching data** or **errors**
- Value build component issues

---

## üì¶ React Apps & Services

### Backend as a Service (BaaS)

Popular services for React applications:

- **Appwrite**
- **Firebase**
- **Supabase**

Good for:

- Social media clips
- E-commerce apps

### freeAPI.app (Open Source by Hitesh Sir)

Explore open-source projects built with React to understand real-world architecture.

---

## üéì After React

- Once you've mastered React basics, learn about **Frameworks:**

  - Next.js ‚Äì Full-stack capabilities (Frontend + Backend)

  - Gatsby ‚Äì Static site generation

  - Remix ‚Äì Data-driven React framework

Next.js allows us to **write backend and frontend in a single framework**.

## üìö Resources

- **Hitesh Choudhary's Channel** - Chai with React playlist
- React.dev Official Documentation
- MDN Web Docs for JavaScript fundamentals

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Don't rush** - Understanding fundamentals is crucial
2. **Prerequisites matter** - Master JavaScript and DOM first
3. **React is a library** - Not a framework, giving you freedom
4. **Learn progressively** - Core concepts ‚û°Ô∏è Components ‚û°Ô∏è State ‚û°Ô∏è Addons
5. **Build projects** - Apply learning through practical applications
6. Got to know most project we don't need React in initial phases.
7. Understand the need for React in modern web development.

**Remember:** React is not a complete solution in most case, no by default SEO. By default, React can't browse/render JavaScript, react has no routing.

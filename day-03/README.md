**Resource:** ChaiCode YouTube Channel â€“ Video 3

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways (From Video 3)

- Understood the complete project folder structure.

- Compared folder structures of CRA (Create React App) vs Vite.

- Learned how React gets injected into the HTML file.

- Understood why React is considered a Single Page Application (SPA):

  - It uses only one HTML file (index.html).

  - React dynamically injects and removes content.

- React creates its own Virtual DOM parallel to the browser DOM (in memory).

- In CRA, react-scripts handle the injection logic.

- Understood the difference between:

  - React: Core library for managing components & state.

  - ReactDOM: Web implementation responsible for rendering UI into browser DOM.

- Learned why Vite is lightweight compared to CRA (removes heavy dependencies like react-scripts and testing libraries).

- In Vite, component files should end with .jsx if using JSX or js.

- Component function names must start with an uppercase letter.

- It is recommended to capitalize the component file names for consistency.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Learned

- Vite is faster, lighter, and more modern.

- Single-page approach with dynamic DOM changes

- React maintains a lightweight DOM copy in memory

- `.jsx` is recommended in Vite setups

- Component functions and file names should start with uppercase

## ðŸ’¡ Summary

- Video 3 mainly explains how React apps are structured and rendered, highlights why modern setups like Vite are preferred over CRA.

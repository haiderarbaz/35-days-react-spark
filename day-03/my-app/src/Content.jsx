      <h2>Key takeaway from day 3</h2>
      <p>Understood the project folder structure</p>
      <p>Compared the folder structure of CRA vs Vite</p>
      <p>Learned how React gets injected into HTML</p>
      <p>
        React is called SPA because it uses only one HTML file and injects or
        remove content dynamically.
      </p>
      <p>React also creates its own DOM parallel to browser DOM in memory</p>
      <p>In CRA React script inject react in HTML file</p>
      <p>
        Understood what React(It's a core foundational library that manages and
        component and state) & ReactDOM(it's a web inplementation of React) do
      </p>
      <p>
        Vite is lightweight compared to CRA because it removes react script,
        testing libraries and much more.
      </p>
      <p>In vite component file name should be end with jsx.</p>
      <p>Function name in component should be in upper case</p>
      <p>It is recommended to that file name should be in capitalise</p>
    </>
